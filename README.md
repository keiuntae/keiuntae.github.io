# Data Science Portfolio
This is my portfolio containing a repository of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

# [Project 1: Breast Cancer Prediction: Project Overview](https://github.com/keiuntae/keiuntae.github.io/tree/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Prediction)
* Created a tool that predicts breast cancer through machine learning tactics by use of breast cancer data.
* Utilized a Wisconsin breast cancer diagnostic data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
* Optimized Logistic, Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector, Decision Tree, and Random Forest regressors to reach best model.
