# Data Science Portfolio
This is my portfolio containing a repository of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

# Project 1: Breast Cancer Prediction: Project Overview
