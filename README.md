### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Keiuntae Smith and I am a current student attending Bellevue University working on My Masters for Data Science. 

# Data Science Portfolio
This is my repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.
